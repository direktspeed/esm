# esm
Top Notch ESM Modules Build from top NPM Modules.

## Why?
There are many npm packages that have a hugh size that adds no value also they are distributed in diffrent formarts and need a complex resolve algorythm to use them this repo trys to unify the most needed dependencys into ESModules so that they can be used and developed more easy This repo will use @stealify tooling to automatic build ESModules from NPM Packages and also republish them under the @direktspeed/esm-* name space
